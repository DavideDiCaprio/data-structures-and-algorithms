Example 1: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k.

'''
Example 2: You are given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" and flip it to a "1". What is the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1"?

For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5. If you perform the flip at index 2, the string becomes 1111100111.'''
